# test
Python test project, which is for a sensor in the electric vehicle , reads stored data from an INI file and compares it with desired values in another INI file.
The project uses the Pytest library to run tests, the coverage library to measure code coverage, and the unittest library to write unit tests to ensure 
the proper function of the sensor system in electric vehicles. :)
